TODO:
1. Inspect invoice page and related buttons triggering view/download.
2. ✅ Inspect existing view invoice button in account/orders page; plan preview dialog approach.
3. ✅ Add service method (if missing) to fetch invoice PDF via new route per docs.
4. ✅ Update view invoice flow to fetch blob, preview inline without auto-saving.
5. ✅ Ensure download button still triggers file save via route.
6. ✅ Replace modal preview with new-tab PDF view; ensure URL revoked when unused.
7. Test integration and clean up object URLs.
8. ✅ Review product listing logic: pagination, sorting, filtering on products page.
9. ✅ Ensure default ordering across pages is ascending by createdAt (oldest first).
10. ✅ Adjust sorting/pagination mechanism to apply order before slicing/paginating.
11. ✅ Validate there’s no regression with existing category filters and manual sort options.
12. Test pagination to confirm first page shows oldest products and later pages progressively newer.
