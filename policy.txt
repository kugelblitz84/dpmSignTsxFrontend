Return & Refund Policy
Dhaka Plastic & Metal | Trusted Craftsmanship. Transparent Policies.

Dhaka Plastic & Metal, we value every customer relationship and strive to deliver customized signage, award crests, and promotional or corporate gift items that exceed expectations. Since all our products are made-to-order, we follow a specific Return & Refund Policy to ensure clarity, fairness, and your peace of mind.
This policy outlines the circumstances under which returns and refunds are processed, and how they are linked to our Exchange Policy.

Return Policy
Due to the customized nature of our products, we do not accept general returns. However, we do accept returns under the following condition:
Return is only applicable if your product qualifies for an exchange under our Exchange Policy.
This includes instances such as major manufacturing defects or clear mismatches with the approved design.
We encourage all customers to thoroughly review our Exchange Policy to understand eligibility for returns and replacements.

Refund Policy
We understand that circumstances can change. That’s why we offer a flexible and transparent refund process based on the stage of your order:
Full Refund
You are entitled to a full refund of your initial payment if:
You cancel your order before the design approval is finalized.
The production process has not yet started.
Partial Refund
If you cancel your order after approving the final design but before production begins, we will deduct a design fee and refund the rest.
The design service charge ranges between BDT 200 to BDT 5,000, based on design complexity and order volume.
The remaining balance will be refunded to your original payment method.
No Refund
Refunds are not applicable in the following cases:
Once production has started, cancellations are no longer accepted.
The product matches the approved design, but does not meet personal preferences or expectations.
The product was damaged after delivery due to mishandling or external factors.
Errors occurred due to incorrect information provided during the order process.
If you are dissatisfied with the delivered product, we do not offer refunds—but we do provide replacements under the terms outlined in our Exchange Policy.

Refund Timeline and Method
Once approved, refunds are processed within 3 to 5 business days.
Refunds will be issued to the same payment method used for the original transaction, including:
Bank transfer
bKash
Other approved payment channels

Design Approval Responsibility
All products are manufactured strictly according to the design approved by you before production.
We encourage you to carefully review all design elements, dimensions, colors, spelling, and layout—before final approval. Dhaka Plastic & Metal is not liable for any errors overlooked during this stage.

Cancellation Policy
Orders can be canceled only before production starts.
Cancellations are not accepted once production has begun due to the customized nature of our products.

We believe in transparency, fairness, and customer satisfaction. Please read our Exchange Policy for complete details on replacements and eligibility conditions.
